### Use cases

Quick writeup of the use cases for the Hackathon.

#### Pasientens m√•ledata (PMD) FHIR API

#### Make a FHIR version of OKT API

#### Nordic tx FHIR server API

#### IG building

FHIR IG authoring for documenting a FHIR RestfulAPI can seem like a big challenge to new FHIR developers. In this track we introduce the participants to FHIR IG authoring, building and how to publish a drawt on Github.

##### Prerequisites

There is no need for prior knowledge on FHIR or IG building before participation. You can build an IG entirely on Github but it will be faster if you have preinstalled the necesary tools on you own computer. Basic knowlege of HL7 FHIR standard is helpful, also a thought about a use-case you want to work with before the workshop.

##### Learning goals

* Basic understanding of the role of FHIR profiling  
* Know the necessary tools for building FHIR IG's  
  * IG publisher  
  * SUSHI  
* Learn how to write FHIR documentation using FSH  
* Learn how to use the tools for FHIR IG authoring  
* Learn how to present a draft IG on Github, using Github.io
