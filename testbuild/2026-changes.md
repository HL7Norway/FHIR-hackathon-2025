## 2026 Changes

### Proposed changes

Get more clinicians on the hackathon to provide feedback and co-devlop API's and software solutions. The goal is to make the clinicians co-develop the solutions by direct communication with architects and developers. The FHIR hackathon is the perfect arena for diect co-development of applications and API's.

### Method

Method for user involvement in software development. The software user, usually clinicians, work with developers and architects to develop software that directly adresses the users concerns and needs.

### Value proposal (use-case)

Why should clinicians care and participate?
