## 2026 Changes

### Learning from 2025

The main learning point from 2025 is that all organizers are motivated to continue working like this and organize another hackathon in 2026.

#### Good

* Great involvement from all the organizers!
* The tracks OKT, PMD and authoring tracks worked great!
* Good size group of participants
* Promotion work from all organizers
* Funding worked perfectly
* Snacks was good
* EHiN photos was great and can be used for promotion

#### OK

* EHiN as arena, did it give us anything?
* Food was OK
* Terminology did not draw much attention
* The room got noisy and maybe a bit to busy?

#### Bad

* Hellerudsletta as venue is not a good solution
* Need more clinicians for some of the discussions (esp. OKT)
* 

### Proposed changes

Make the FHIR hackathon the perfect arena for diect co-development of applications and API's.

Goals for 2026:

* Get more clinicians to participate in the hackathon to facilitate co-developments of API's and software solutions by developers and end users. 
* Refine user needs by providing user feedback based on testing.
* Describe wanted changes based on refined user needs.
 
* Make actual end user applications and prototypes and implement quick changes to the api and end-user applications.

### Method

Method for user involvement in software development. The software user, usually clinicians, work with developers and architects to develop software that directly adresses the users concerns and needs.

* **User needs** Establish and prioritize user needs and concerns to work with in this iteration.
* **Design** Design software products that addresses the prioritized user needs.
* **Development** Develop prototypes and software products.
* **Testing** Testing the software products/prototypes, both technical and by the users.
* **Discusion and evaluation** Discuss the test results and evaluate how the product adresses the user needs.
* **Iteration feedback** Add and update user needs and concerns discovered in the iteration.

### Value proposal (use-case)

Why should clinicians care and participate?
